         <h2>Data collected in Coders Route Games</h2>
         <h5><i>Last updated 17 August 2021</i></h5>

         <p class="lead">
         Coders Route is committed to the protection of your privacy. Any collected data will only ever be used in accordance with this policy. This policy will also let you know about what information is collected by our third-party service providers, and link to how you can find out about how they use it.
         <br/><br/>
         This policy applies to all versions of the game "Grab The Flag" and their associated websites or other applications ("Games").
         <br/><br/>
         By playing Coders Route Games you are consenting to the collection of data as outlined in this privacy policy. You also accept that this privacy policy can be updated from time to time for any reason, with the latest date of changes published at the top of this page.
         </p>
         <br/>

         <h3>Collection of Data</h3>
         <p class="lead">
         <u>Sensitive Data:</u> Coders Route does not collect sensitive information about you. <br/><br/>

         <u>Personally identifiable Data:</u> Our Games collect certain non-sensitive, data as outlined in this privacy policy. Some of this information is automatically gathered, and could be considered personally identifiable in certain circumstances, however it will generally always be anonymised prior to being viewed by Coders Route, and never sold or shared. 
         <br/><br/>
         Personally identifiable data will only otherwise be actively collected by Coders Route in very specific circumstances, such as if you contact us directly.
         </p>

         <h3>Why Collect Data?</h3><br/><br/>
         <p class="lead">
         <u>Player Feedback and Support:</u> 
         <br/>
         If you contact us with a comment or query, Coders Route will keep a copy of any personal information you provide. This is so that we can respond to your comments and questions as a part of our commitment to providing you with player support. If you contact us directly for any reason, we also keep a copy of that correspondence. 
         <br/><br/>

         <u>Advertising and Analytics:</u> 
         <br/>
         Advertising: When we offer our Games as free-to-play, we still require the game to generate income to help fund development costs and efforts to make the best game possible. Advertising is one way we can help cover our costs, and in order to implement relevant advertising a certain amount of information may be collected by each third-party ad network that operates within our Games. That information may be considered personally identifiable, or it could be considered personally identifiable in certain circumstances. This information is only ever used for our legitimate business interests and will never be sold or shared by us. 
         <br/><br/>
         Nevertheless, the data is provided to us by third parties.  While we use all reasonable commercial endeavours to ensure that they adhere to any applicable laws, we encourage you to familiarise yourself with their data policies.
         <br/><br/>
         A list of each ad network we use and information about what data they collect is contained at the conclusion of this policy. Please read those privacy policies carefully before using our Games.
         <br/><br/>
         Analytics: Information collected about our Game usage and about your device and location, allows us to better integrate updates, find potential device specific problems and bugs, explore localisation opportunities and make better Games that are tailored to our user's needs. 
         </p>


         <h3>How Do we Use Data We Collect</h3><br/><br/>
         <p class="lead">
         <u>Data collected for Advertising</u>
         <br/>
         Because many Coders Route Games are free-to-play, we periodically display in-game advertising by third parties to generate revenue. In order to display relevant advertising (also known as "interest based advertising") and measure performance of advertising campaigns we have implemented several ad-networks within the game which may collect and transfer non-sensitive device information such as:


         <ul class="dots">
             <li>The advertisement you have viewed and if you have engaged with it;</li>
             <li>Device make and manufacturer;</li>
             <li>Operating System;</li>
             <li>Generic geographic location, such as the city you are located in;</li>
             <li>Carrier;</li>
             <li>Language settings;</li>
             <li>IP Address;</li>
             <li>Android Advertising identifier or Apple Identifier for Advertisers.</li>
         </ul>
         </p>

         <p class="lead">
         <br/>
         <u>Data collected for Analytics</u>
         <br/>
         We have implemented Analytics tools to help us understand how our Games are being used in order to help us improve our Games and plan for future game releases. For example we use Flurry Analytics and Firebase Analytics to keep track of how many players are engaging with our Games, player progress, any in-app purchases, as well as device type, operating system, language settings, play session lengths and broad geographic information like your country and city.

         </p>

         <h3>Opt Out of interest-based advertising</h3></br></br>
         <p class="lead">
         It is possible to opt out of interest-based advertising. In doing so, a lot of the data captured by us or our third-party service providers will not be collected. 
         <br/><br/>
         <u>Your Device controls</u></br>
         If you would like to opt-out of interest based advertising, we recommend following the below steps.
               </p>
         <ul class="dots">
             <li><h3>Apple devices:</h3><p class="lead"> Follow the steps outlined on <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT202074">this Apple support page</a></p></li>
             <li><h3>Android devices:</h3><p class="lead"> Navigate to the Google settings App, select Ads and then choose to reset your Android Ad ID or opt-out of personalized ads.</p></li>
